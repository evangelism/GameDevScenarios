Attaching 2 bundles developed by our partner https://arvare.com/  whoâ€™s specializing on game development.
Having an expertise in working with different cloud providers, theyâ€™ve created 2 Unity based scenarios  we can leverage in the form of a workshop (using Azure services of course ðŸ˜Š):
1. Saving game progress from Unity to the Cloud.
2. Dynamic loading of game content in Unity from the Ð¡loud.

--	The provided materials in these workshops are cross-platform so we can use them in VR/AR applications development.
--  These bundles help us to deliver our game story to broad audience not only big game companies and publishers with special conditions.
